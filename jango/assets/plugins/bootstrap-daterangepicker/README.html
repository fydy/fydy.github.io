<p>This date range picker component for Bootstrap creates a dropdown menu from which a user can
select a range of dates. I created it while building the UI for <a href="http://www.improvely.com">Improvely</a>, 
which needed a way to select date ranges for reports.</p>
<p>Features include limiting the selectable date range, localizable strings and date formats,
a single date picker mode, optional time picker (for e.g. making appointments or reservations),
and styles that match the default Bootstrap 3 theme.</p>
